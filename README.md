# LabC decision-tree-learning algorithm

* The datasets are in the `Data` folder.
* The main code for the program is in the `DecisionTree` folder.
* To run the `decision-tree-learning` algorithm on the datasets, run `main.py` using Python3 and pass in the path to the dataset file as an argument. For example:
```
python main.py Data/pets.txt
```
* That will output the constructed decision tree.
* This file runs on `tools.cs.earlham.edu`.
